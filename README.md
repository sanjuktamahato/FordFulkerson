# FordFulkerson
The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm computes the maximum flow in a flow network. It repeatedly finds augmenting paths from source to sink using residual capacities and updates flows along these paths. It continues until no more augmenting paths exist. It's fundamental in network flow problems like traffic or data routing.
